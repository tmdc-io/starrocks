/**
 * DataOSClient serves as the primary integration point between StarRocks and DataOS platform services.
 * 
 * <p>This client provides a comprehensive interface for StarRocks to interact with various
 * DataOS services, including:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Heimdall: Authentication and authorization service</li>
 * <li>Depot resolver: Data source location and configuration service</li>
 * <li>Secret manager: Credential management service for external systems</li>
 * <li>Policy engine: Data access policy enforcement service</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>The client is organized into logical sections that correspond to these service integrations,
 * facilitating centralized management of all DataOS platform interactions. This design
 * allows StarRocks to leverage DataOS platform capabilities while maintaining a clean
 * separation of concerns.
 * 
 * <p>In production environments, this class implements calls to the actual DataOS services.
 * The current implementation includes API signatures with logging placeholders that can be
 * replaced with actual service calls.
